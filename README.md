# Hello People,
I'm Getting to know Git-Hub to help me learn C++ (a language
I started to learn 20+ years ago and haven't touched since and
therefore forgotten, and now decided to re-learn).

I'm not trying to write the next 'World-Conquering' piece of software,
I simply want to write a few programs that I can use myself and
increase my programming knowledge.

I'm also hoping to meet some nice, friendly, helpful coders as well.

Regards, Angus.
